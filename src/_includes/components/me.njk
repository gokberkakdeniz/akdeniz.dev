      <br/>
      I am a junior year computer engineering student at 
      <a href="https://en.iyte.edu.tr/" title="Izmir Institute of Technology" style="text-decoration: none;">IZTECH</a>. 
      I like to learn new technologies, concepts, and various topics.  
      I am very fond of finding answers of "why" and "how" questions 
      to understand everything thoroughly. 
      I am currently working as a Frontend Developer.
